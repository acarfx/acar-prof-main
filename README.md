# Acar-Prof-Main

**ACAR Professional Moderation, Promotion & Coin System Bot**

A Discord bot featuring an automated promotion system, coin economy, moderation tools, registration workflows, and a clean modular architecture. Customizable and extensible for your needs.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Automated Promotions & Coin System**
  Users can earn coins and be promoted automatically based on their tagged status, message activity, voice activity, and registration data. The system supports toggling these features ON/OFF.

* **Advanced Moderation & Penalty Dashboard**
  Includes enhanced logging, punishment tracking, and structured penalty handling mechanisms.

* **Smart Registration System**

  * **Tagged-only mode enabled:** If a user does not have the required tag, registration is blocked automatically.
  * **Tagged-only mode disabled:** Registration is allowed if the user's gender data is provided.

* **Plug-and-Play Database Adaptability**
  You can switch out the database platform quickly. Edit only the internals of functions in `./Reference/acarDatabase.js`, without touching the system‚Äôs logic.

* **Invite System Placeholder**
  Invite-based rewards are not included due to potential exploitation (e.g., J4J abuse). A separate module may be implemented in the future.

* **Guard Bot & Auto-channel Setup (Upcoming)**
  Future updates will include deployment with a guard bot, automatic channel creation, and MongoDB/MySQL integration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Configuration

1. **Explore Settings**
   Review all files in `./acar/Settings/`. Misconfigurations (like missing role IDs or incorrect channel names) can break the system.

2. **Channel Configuration (`kanallar.json`)**
   Channel names inside `kanallar.json` must match your server‚Äôs log channel names. (Automatic setup coming soon.)

3. **Role & Promotion Logic**
   In `./acar/Reference/acarDatabase.js`, you can customize behavior for ‚ÄúMonarch‚Äù and ‚ÄúKnaves‚Äù role types‚Äîspecifically around handling ‚ÄúHammer‚Äù role grants.

4. **Promotion Levels (`terfisystem.js`)**
   Define rank levels using:

   ```js
   yetkipuan: [
     { rol: "first_role_id", seviye: "0" },
     { rol: "second_role_id", seviye: "1" },
     ...
     { rol: "seventh_role_id", seviye: "6" },
   ]
   ```

   Example toggle: if `getir.seviye === 2` (third rank), give the user a `teleportHammer` role if they don‚Äôt already have it.
